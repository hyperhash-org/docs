# 📘 Hyper Hash Network — Documentation Hub

This repository contains the complete technical and operational documentation for the **Hyper Hash Network**, including architecture, roadmap, node deployment guides, and financial specifications.

## 🧭 Purpose

The `hyperhash-org/docs` repository serves as the **single source of truth** for:
- Network-wide architecture and component interaction
- Deployment and operations manuals
- Lightning & Treasury specifications
- Roadmaps, changelogs, and governance notes
- UI and MMI feature references

All other Hyper Hash repositories (`hyperhash-core`, `hh-pool`, `hh-tp`, etc.) link back to this repo for canonical documentation.

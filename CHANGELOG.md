HYPER HASH NETWORK â€” DEVELOPMENT CHANGELOG AND TASK REGISTER (VERSION 0)
1. PURPOSE

This document is the authoritative engineering backlog and progress ledger for the Hyper Hash Network.
It defines every build, configuration, verification, and documentation task required to deploy a fully operational, production-grade mining network across Core, Hyper Nodes, Lightning Treasury, Template Providers, and Web Interfaces.

Each item in this file represents a trackable, testable unit of work.
All tasks begin as ðŸ§© PLANNED and are updated to ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS or âœ… COMPLETE as code moves through review and deployment.

This document functions as both:

A CHANGELOG (record of major versions, commits, and milestones).

A TASK REGISTER (comprehensive engineering plan with GitHub-linked tasks).

2. FORMAT AND STATUS CODES

Format Rules:

Each task has a unique ID per subsystem (e.g., C002d or N307.3).

Use concise one-line titles followed by a brief description.

Status options:

ðŸ§© PLANNED â€” not yet started

ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â€” active development

âœ… COMPLETE â€” merged and verified on mainnet

Every PR and Issue must reference its task ID in the title or description.

This file should always reflect the current canonical state of the network.

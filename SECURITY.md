HYPER HASH NETWORK — SECURITY AND TRUST FRAMEWORK (VERSION 0)
1. PURPOSE

This document defines the security architecture of the Hyper Hash Network.
It establishes policies for authentication, authorization, encryption, key management, auditing, and incident response across all operational layers.
The objective is to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all systems without compromising decentralization or usability.

2. SECURITY PRINCIPLES

Zero-Trust Architecture – Every connection, even internal, must authenticate cryptographically.

Least-Privilege Access – Services operate with only the permissions they require.

Defense-in-Depth – Multiple overlapping controls protect critical assets.

Key Separation – Distinct key material for Core, Treasury, Nodes, and operators.

Auditability – All actions leave a verifiable, tamper-resistant log trail.

Recoverability – Systems can be rebuilt from clean backups without loss of funds or data.

3. IDENTITY HIERARCHY
Entity	Identity Type	Description
Hyper Hash Core	X.509 TLS cert, JWT signing key	Root of trust; signs node registrations and manifests
Hyper Node	mTLS client cert + Node ID	Authenticates to Core for telemetry, control, and payouts
Treasury	Lightning node pubkey	Trust anchor for all LN settlements
Operator	SSH + GitHub GPG key	Human administrator identity
Miner	Stratum session token	Temporary, session-scoped credential

Each identity type has its own key lifecycle and renewal process.

4. AUTHENTICATION MODEL

Between Core ↔ Nodes
• Mutual TLS (mTLS) required for every API or telemetry channel.
• Core issues signed certificates with 90-day validity.
• Node Agent renews automatically before expiry.

Between Treasury ↔ Nodes
• Authentication handled by Lightning node pubkeys.
• All LN invoices are signed using node secrets; Treasury verifies signatures.

Between Miners ↔ Nodes
• Stratum V2 noise protocol provides authenticated key exchange and session encryption.
• Legacy SV1 sessions pass through Translator with TLS termination.

5. AUTHORIZATION AND ACCESS CONTROL

• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced by the Core API.
• Roles: Core Admin, Node Operator, Treasury Ops, Read-Only Observer.
• Each role maps to fine-grained API scopes defined in /etc/hyperhash/roles.yml.
• Node Agents can execute only signed instructions verified via JSON Web Signatures (JWS).
• Human access limited through sudoers and system groups.

6. KEY MANAGEMENT

Generation:
• All keys generated locally with secure entropy sources.
• No private key ever leaves its originating host.

Storage:
• TLS certificates stored in /etc/hyperhash/certs/ with 600 permissions.
• Lightning macaroons and seeds encrypted via SOPS and GPG KMS.
• PostgreSQL credentials managed through environment variables read-only to service user.

Rotation:
• TLS certs – 90 days
• JWT signing keys – 180 days
• LN macaroons – 30 days
• SSH keys – 180 days
Rotation executed automatically through cron and GitHub Actions pipeline.

7. ENCRYPTION POLICY
Layer	Protocol	Cipher Suite
API / Telemetry	TLS 1.3	ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
Stratum V2	Noise Protocol	ChaCha20-Poly1305
Storage	SOPS + AES-256-GCM	Encrypted YAML/JSON
Backups	GPG AES-256	Multi-recipient encryption
LN Invoices	SHA256 HMAC	Embedded signature

All encryption keys are 256-bit or stronger.

8. SECRET DISTRIBUTION

• Secrets never stored in plaintext within Git.
• Operators receive temporary decryption tokens via GitHub OIDC + SOPS.
• Deployment pipelines decrypt configs only at runtime in volatile memory.
• Core never transmits private Lightning credentials to Nodes.

9. SOFTWARE SUPPLY-CHAIN SECURITY

Repositories signed and verified using GitHub’s GPG commit verification.

Build artifacts hashed with SHA256 and checksums published.

Node Agents verify manifest signatures before upgrades.

Docker images built in isolated CI runners and scanned for CVEs.

External dependencies pinned to exact versions.

10. NETWORK SECURITY

• All inbound traffic restricted via UFW; only Stratum, HTTPS, and Lightning ports exposed.
• Internal communications traverse VPN or private VLAN.
• Treasury node isolated on separate subnet with limited egress.
• Rate-limits and SYN-cookies enabled on all interfaces.
• DDoS mitigation provided by upstream firewall.

11. LIGHTNING NETWORK SECURITY

• Treasury operates multi-sig wallet (2-of-3 quorum).
• Channels use static remote keys and anchor outputs for on-chain recovery.
• Watchtowers monitor all open channels for revoked transactions.
• Auto-rebalancing capped to safe liquidity ratios.
• LN telemetry logs encrypted and redacted before storage.

12. BITCOIN NODE SECURITY

• Bitcoind runs as non-root user bitcoin.
• RPC interfaces bound to localhost only.
• Tor proxy support optional for privacy.
• Wallet.dat disabled on Core nodes; Treasury uses Lightning wallet exclusively.
• Mempool limited to 300 MB and purged hourly to prevent spam attacks.

13. AUDIT AND LOGGING

• Every signed command or payout recorded in immutable audit ledger.
• Audit entries include: timestamp, actor ID, action type, signature hash, result code.
• Logs replicated to Loki with append-only access.
• Quarterly security audits cover key rotation, wallet reconciliation, and RBAC validation.

14. INCIDENT RESPONSE

Detection – Alert triggered via Prometheus / Loki.

Triage – Core Ops classifies incident severity.

Containment – Compromised host isolated from network.

Eradication – Keys revoked, certificates replaced, data restored.

Recovery – Systems verified, nodes resynchronized.

Post-Mortem – Report published to GitHub and Discord #operations within 48 hours.

Incident tickets labeled SEC-YYYY-MM-## in GitHub for traceability.

15. PHYSICAL SECURITY

• Core and Treasury VMs hosted in Tier-3 data centers with 24/7 monitoring.
• Backups stored in geographically redundant locations.
• Cold-storage wallets kept offline with encrypted external drives.
• Access controlled by MFA and audit logs retained for seven years.

16. COMPLIANCE AND GOVERNANCE

• Aligns with ISO 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 principles.
• Annual third-party penetration tests.
• Quarterly internal compliance checklists for key handling and node registration.
• Public disclosure policy for vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories.

17. OPERATOR RESPONSIBILITIES

• Never reuse private keys across nodes.
• Report security events immediately to Discord #operations.
• Verify digital signatures before applying updates.
• Keep local systems patched and updated weekly.
• Maintain offline backup of wallet seeds in secure location.

18. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS (SECURITY EVENTS)

Security coordination and disclosures occur only through:

1. Discord — Primary Incident Channel
https://discord.com/channels/1409546566116839490/1410138982204838009

Used for immediate alerts, coordination, and key revocation announcements.

2. GitHub — Issue and Advisory Tracking
https://github.com/hyperhash-org

All security advisories, post-mortems, and vulnerability reports published via GitHub Security Advisory system.

No other communication platforms are authorized for incident handling.
